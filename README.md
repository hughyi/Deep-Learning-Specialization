# Deep Learning Specialization Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the **programming assignments** for the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

## Overview
The specialization consists of five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5. **Sequence Models**

For future reference, my notes for this course can be found on [here](https://www.notion.so/Deep-Learning-Specialization-0be76f5aa3de4fed8b2a6683c29aa90f?pvs=4)
