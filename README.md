# Deep Learning Specialization Programming Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments for the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng.

## Overview
The specialization consists of five courses:

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization, and Optimization**
3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**
4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**
5. **Sequence Models**
